console.log(13%7);// Output: 6 because when you divide 13 by 7, the quotient is 1 with a remainder of 6. The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder after dividing the first operand (13) by the second operand (7), which is 6 in this case.
console.log(101%2);//Output: 1 because when you divide 10 by 3, the quotient is 3 with a remainder of 1. The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder after dividing the first operand (10) by the second operand (3), which is 1 in this case.
console.log(103%3);// Output: 1 because when you divide 10 by 3, the quotient is 3 with a remainder of 1. The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder after dividing the first operand (10) by the second operand (3), which is 1 in this case.


console.log(a**b);// Output: 30 because the multiplication operator (*) multiplies the value of a (10) by the value of b (3), resulting in 30.
